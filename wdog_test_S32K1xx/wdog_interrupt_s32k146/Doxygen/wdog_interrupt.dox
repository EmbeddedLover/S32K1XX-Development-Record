    @brief Example application that will show the usage of the Watchdog

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    The purpose of this driver application is to show the user how to use the WDOG from the S32K146 using the S32 SDK API.

    The examples uses the SysTick timer from the ARM core to refresh the WDOG counter for 8 times. After this the Watchdog counter will expire and the CPU will be reset.
    If the FLASH configuration will be used, then the code will use the Reset Control Module to detect if the reset was caused by the Watchdog and will stop the execution of the program.

    Run the example on Devkit:
    1. After reset, GREEN LED and RED LED is off.
    2. Initialize WDOG Interrupt above then RED LED is toggle 8 times( on 4 times and off 4 times).
    3. Watchdog timeout happen then MCU reset and GREEN LED and RED LED is on and The program will stopped.

    ## Prerequisites ##
    _____
    To run the example you will need to have the following items:
    - 1 S32K146 board
    - 1 Power Adapter 12V
    - 1 Personal Computer
    - 2 Dupont female to female cable
    - 1 Jlink Lite Debugger (optional, users can use Open SDA)

    ## Boards supported ##
    _____
    The following boards are supported by this application:
    - S32K146EVB-Q144
    - S32K14xCVD-Q144 with S32K146 chip

    ## Hardware Wiring ##
    _____

    The following connections must be done to for this example application to work:

    PIN FUNCTION         |  S32K146EVB-Q144               |  S32K14xCVD-Q144
    ---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------
    RED_LED (\b PTD15)   | RGB_RED - wired on the boards  | J12.17 - J11.31
    GREEN_LED (\b PTD16) | RGB_GREEN - wired on the board | J12.16 - J11.30

    ## How to run ##
    _____
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New \b S32DS \b Project \b From... and select \b wdog_interrupt_s32k146. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    #### 2. Generating the Processor Expert configuration ####
    First go to \b Project \b Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project(\b wdog_interrupt_s32k146). Then go to \b Project and click on \b Generate \b Processor \b Expert \b Code \n
    Wait for the code generation to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b FLASH (Debug_FLASH) or \b RAM (Debug_RAM) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the bulid action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be four debug configurations for this project:
     Configuration Name                            | Description
     ----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
     \b wdog_interrupt_s32k146_debug_ram_jlink     | Debug the RAM configuration using Segger Jlink debuggers
     \b wdog_interrupt_s32k146_debug_flash_jlink   | Debug the FLASH configuration using Segger Jlink debuggers
     \b wdog_interrupt_s32k146_debug_ram_pemicro   | Debug the RAM configuration using PEMicro debuggers
     \b wdog_interrupt_s32k146_debug_flash_pemicro | Debug the FLASH configuration using PEMicro debuggers
    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.
